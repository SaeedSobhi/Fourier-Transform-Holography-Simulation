# Fourier-Transform-Holography-Simulation
Fourier Transform Holography (FTH) Simulation, with the ability to change the factors with interactive sliders 
give the ability to change: 
          Pinhole position (one slider for x position and another for y position)
          Pinhole size 
          Detector's shape (square or circle)

The output should look like this:
